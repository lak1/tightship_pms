# Tightship PMS - Production Readiness Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Tightship PMS has a solid foundation but needs critical work before production deployment. This roadmap outlines the path to becoming a polished, production-ready SaaS menu management platform.

## Current State Assessment

### âœ… What's Working Well
- Core menu management functionality
- Multi-restaurant support
- Platform pricing management
- Public API for menu display
- Modern tech stack (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Prisma)

### ðŸš¨ Critical Gaps for Production
- Security vulnerabilities (hardcoded credentials, no rate limiting)
- No subscription/billing system
- Missing admin dashboard
- No email service integration
- Limited error handling and monitoring
- No user tier management

---

## Phase 1: Critical Security & Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Remove Security Vulnerabilities
```typescript
// Remove hardcoded demo credentials
// File: src/lib/auth.ts - Lines 55-62
// TODO: Remove demo user logic entirely
```

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Add environment-based configuration
- [ ] Audit all credential storage

### 1.2 Implement Rate Limiting
```typescript
// Install rate limiting package
npm install express-rate-limit @upstash/ratelimit
```

**Implementation:**

- [ ] Add rate limiting to public API (100 requests/minute)
- [ ] Add rate limiting to data mutations (30 requests/minute)
- [ ] Implement IP-based and user-based limits

### 1.3 Error Tracking & Monitoring
```typescript
// Install Sentry
npm install @sentry/nextjs
```

**Setup:**
